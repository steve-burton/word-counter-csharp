# Word Counter

#### December 2, 2016

#### By **Steve Burton**

### Specifications
This program will take a user word and a string of words and return the number of times the word appears in the string. The homepage should contain a form for user inputs, and the results should be returned on a second page, with a link back to the homepage.

These are the steps I'll take to write my code:

Take a user input word and find it in a second user input string that consists of the same word.
* Input: word, "hello"; string, "hello"
* Output: "hello"

Take a user input word and find it in a second user input string of multiple words. Return the number of matches.
* Input: word, "hello"; string, "hello world"
* Output: 1

Take a user input word and find it in a second user input string that contains multiple matches. Return the number of matches. This should account for case sensitivity.
* Input: "Hello world hello"
* Output: 2
