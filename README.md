# Word Counter

#### December 2, 2016

#### By **Steve Burton**

### Specifications
This program will take a user word and a string of words and return the number of times the word appears in the string. The homepage should contain a form for user inputs, and the results should be returned on a second page, with a link back to the homepage.

These are the steps I'll take to write my code:

Take a user input word and find it in a second user input sentence that consists of the same word. Return the number of matches.
* Input: word, "hello"; sentence, "hello"
* Output: 1

Take a user input word and find it in a second user input sentence that contains multiple matches. Return the number of matches.
* Input: "hello world hello"
* Output: 2

Take a user input word and find it in a second user sentence that contains matches in upper and lower case. Return the number of matches.
* Input: "Hello world hello"
* Output: 2
